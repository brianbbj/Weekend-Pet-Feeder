# Weekend-Pet-Feeder
This project involves creating an automated pet feeder that dispenses food on schedule, maintains water levels, and alerts the owner when resources are low. It utilizes the TM4C123GXL microcontroller, along with sensors, motors, and 3D-printed components, demonstrating the integration of electronics and hardware in a functional prototype.
