# Weekend-Pet-Feeder
Developed an automated pet feeder that maintains water levels, dispenses food on schedule, and detects nearby pets to freshen water. Integrated sensors, motors, and capacitive water sensing for functionality. Alerts owners when water is low. Uses food-safe materials and sealed PLA components.
- Developed an innovative automated pet feeder for maintaining and monitoring water levels.
- Programmed to dispense predetermined amounts of food at scheduled times.
- Integrated passive IR sensors to detect nearby pets and freshen water with small additions.
- Designed visual and audible notifications to alert pet owners when water levels are low.
- Utilized food-safe containers and delivery systems to ensure health standards compliance.
- Sealed PLA-printed components to minimize bacterial contamination risks.
- Interfaced motors with MOSFET drivers, a capacitive water sensing circuit, and a speaker.
- Implemented a safe and reliable electrical circuit operating with an external DC supply and USB power source.
