# Weekend-Pet-Feeder
This project involves creating an automated pet feeder that dispenses food on schedule, maintains water levels, and alerts the owner when resources are low. It utilizes the TM4C123GXL microcontroller, along with sensors, motors, and 3D-printed components, demonstrating the integration of electronics and hardware in a functional prototype.

## Key Features
- **Automatic Water Level Maintenance:** Senses and refills the water dish when the level is low.
- **Freshens Water:** Dispenses small amounts of water when a pet is detected nearby.
- **Scheduled Food Dispensing:**  Allows owners to set specific feeding times, dispensing pre-measured amounts of kibble at scheduled intervals.
- **Low Water Alert:**  Notifies the owner with visual and audible signals when water is critically low.
- **Integrated Sensors:**  Utilizes Passive Infrared (PIR) sensors for pet detection and capacitive sensors to monitor water levels.
